It was designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming."),
	QnA(2, "What is Compiling and Interpreting?", "Compiler is a translator that takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language.\nThe work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code (format of 0s and 1s) so that computers can understand,\nwhile an interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language.\nThe interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc."),
